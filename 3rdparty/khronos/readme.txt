This directory contains OpenGL header files from Khronos.

Please see https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/index_es.php for their origin.

Because the Khronos headers expect #include <GLES2/xyz.h> to work, the compiler points to this directory 
as an include path, so best be careful what we put here.

Each header defines the copyright, licenses for the Khronos header files are either Apache 2 or MIT.
