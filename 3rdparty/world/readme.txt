Note that this is a bit post-processed so we can feed it into GL relatively easily,
the same post-processed file appears as https://firecrest.com/static/wireframe.html
(which, unlike the extension suggests, is a binary file (local debug instance of IIS
tripped over any non-HTML extension)) The binary file is converted into a float array
containing coordinate pairs for each line.

Used by the demo_world_is_yours.c line drawing demo.
